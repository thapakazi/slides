    Lets  get started !!


* Quick Recap 📚

  - with docker, we make "boxes"
  - "boxes" with your code, dependencies, and configuration.
    - these "boxes" can be:
      - *Built* on one computer.
      - *Pushed* and stored remotely.
      - *Pulled* to another computer.
      - And simply *run* anywhere.

  - docker-compose:
    - working with those boxes made easy
    - with a simple yaml file and simple commands (up/down)

  - these simplifies:
    + *building*  |  *sharing* | *running*
    ...applications consistently across different machines with few commands

* BUT ✋🏼
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Memorising docker commands is hard.
    #+END_QUOTE

* BUT ✋🏼🤨
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Memorising aliases is slightly less hard.
    #+END_QUOTE


* BUT ✋🏼🫤
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is near impossible.
    #+END_QUOTE

   ...You had all the information you needed

   - in one terminal window
   - with every common command living one keypress away
