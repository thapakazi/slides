    Lets  get started !!

* Quick Recap 📚

  - with docker, we make "boxes"
  - "boxes" with your code, dependencies, and configuration.
    - these "boxes" can be:
      - *Built* on one computer
      - *Pushed* and stored remotely.
      - *Pulled* to another computer.
      - And simply *run* anywhere.

  - docker-compose:
    - working with those boxes made easy
    - with a simple yaml file and simple commands (up/down)

  - these simplifies:
    + *building*  |  *sharing* | *running*
    ...applications consistently across different machines with few commands


* BUT ✋🏼
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Memorising docker commands is hard.
    #+END_QUOTE

    #+begin_src bash
# docker ps and exec it container
docker ps
docker exec -i -t my-app bash
docker exec -i -t CONTAINER_ID bash

# docker compose rituals
docker compose up
docker compose ps
doker compose logs -f app
docker compose logs -f app --tail 20
    #+end_src

* BUT ✋🏼🤨
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Memorising aliases is slightly less hard.
    #+END_QUOTE

Too many aliases and functions 😵

    #+begin_src bash
alias dl='docker ps -lq'
alias dll='docker_fit ps -l'
alias dps='docker_fit ps -a'

function dk(){docker compose "$@" }
function dke(){dk exec "$@" }
function dkl(){dk logs -f "$@" }
function dkr(){dk restart "$@" }

function docker_img_sort_size(){ docker images --format '{{.ID}}   {{.Size}}   {{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}' |sort -n -k 2 }
    #+end_src

* BUT ✋🏼🫤
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is +near impossible+. is not fun
    #+END_QUOTE

 #+CAPTION: but i use tmux
                            [[../images/but_i_use_tmux.png]]


* What if told you 🪄
#+CAPTION: what if i told you

                            [[../images/what_if_i_told_you.png]]



  *You had all the information you needed*
   - in one terminal window
   - with every common command living one keypress away

* Show me what you got...🥸
#+CAPTION: show me what you got

                            [[../images/show-me-what-you-got-rick-and-morty.gif]]

* Everyday rituals 😅

  -    View logs

  -    View environment variables

  -    Check configuration

  -    Exec into shell

  -    Enter into the debugger
